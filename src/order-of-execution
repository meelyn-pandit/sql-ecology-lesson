-- order of execution

-- don't need to display a column to sort by it
SELECT genus, species
FROM species
WHERE taxa = 'Bird'
ORDER BY species_id ASC;

-- sorting occurs earlier in the computational pipeline than field selection
-- order of operations:
	-- 1. filtering rows according to WHERE
	-- 2. sorting results according to ORDER BY
	-- 3. displaying requested columns or expressions.
-- clauses are written in a fixed order: SELECT, FROM, WHERE, then ORDER BY.

-- Challenge - from surveys, display three date fields, species_id, and weight in kg (rounded to two decimal places), for individuals captured in 1999, ordered alphabetically by the species_id
SELECT year, month, day, species_id, ROUND(weight/1000, 2)
FROM surveys 
WHERE (year = 1999) 
ORDER BY species_id ASC;
