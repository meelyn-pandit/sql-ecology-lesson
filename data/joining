-- joins - to combine data from two tables we use JOIN clause, which comes after the FROM clause
-- JOIN keyword combined with ON is used to combine fields from separate tables.
-- ON tells computer which columns provide the link between two tables

SELECT *
FROM surveys
JOIN species
ON surveys.species_id = species.species_id;

--ON is like WHERE. it filters things out according to a test condition

-- alternatively we can used the word USING as a short-hand. USING only works on columns which share the same name.
SELECT *
FROM surveys
JOIN species
USING (species_id);

-- the output with USING will only have one species_id column (ON had two)

-- joining surveys and species by species_id without having species_id in the table
SELECT surveys.year, surveys.month, surveys.day, species.genus, species.species
FROM surveys
JOIN species
ON surveys.species_id = species.species_id;
